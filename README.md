# Video-Based Frailty Assessment Tool (vFM)

This repository provides the code for a video-based frailty meter (vFM), a lightweight AI-powered web application that enables remote assessment of physical frailty from a 20-second elbow flexion/extension task recorded via webcam.

The tool is based on our 2024 study published in *Biomedical Engineering Letters*, which validates the vFM against a sensor-based frailty meter (sFM) and demonstrates its accuracy, usability, and robustness across various environments.

## ðŸ§  About the Model

The vFM utilizes Googleâ€™s [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/) framework to extract elbow motion from video and compute biomechanical featuresâ€”such as slowness, weakness, rigidity, and exhaustion. These features are then used to calculate a frailty index (FI) ranging from 0 to 1. The platform supports both single-task and dual-task conditions.

This tool is especially suited for:
- Telehealth environments
- Remote patient monitoring
- Frailty screening without sensors or wearables

## ðŸ§ª How It Works

1. Upload a 20-second video of elbow flexion/extension (with or without cognitive task).
2. The app extracts elbow joint kinematics using MediaPipe.
3. A frailty index is calculated and made available for download.

For detailed methodology and validation, see our published study below.
